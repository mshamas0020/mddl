MDDL - MIDI Dynamic Development Language
A Novel Language for Music Programming

"MDDL is a MIDI-based, procedural, musical programming language. All source code for a MDDL program is comprised of MIDI files that are executed by an interpreter, and each program itself uses MIDI as both input and output.Â 


MDDL bridges the gap between music composition and programming, and as such, the syntax of the language was designed to reflect concepts in music theory. Overlapping melodies, chords, and more, are analogous to tokens of text-based languages.


The implementation of MDDL is as an interpreter. The interpreter is statically typed, memory managed, garbage collected, and more, allowing efficient interpretation of large MIDI files, both as programs and as program inputs.


Additionally, the MDDL interpreter is packaged with a REPL that allows live programming and asynchronous input, giving MDDL programs the ability to respond in real time to what the user plays. A dynamic environment and a terse, flexible syntax allows the user to create these unique performances with relatively little setup. When standard or user-made libraries are added, there exists potential for highly advanced real-time processing."

TODO:
This is a WIP repo and will have more added to it (including documentation, .mid libraries, etc.) as time goes on.
